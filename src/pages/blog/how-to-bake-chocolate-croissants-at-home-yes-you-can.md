### 🕐 Step-by-Step: How to Make Chocolate Croissants

#### **1. Make the Dough (Day 1)**

In a large bowl, mix the yeast with warm water and let sit for 5–10 minutes until foamy. Add milk, sugar, salt, and flour. Stir until a shaggy dough forms. Knead until smooth, about 5–8 minutes. Cover and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.

#### **2. Prep the Butter Block**

Place your cold butter between two sheets of parchment paper. Use a rolling pin to flatten it into a 6-inch square. Keep it cold in the fridge.

#### **3. Laminate the Dough**

Roll out your dough into a 10-inch square. Place the butter block in the center at a diagonal, like a diamond inside a square. Fold the dough corners over the butter like an envelope. Seal it well.

Now roll the dough into a long rectangle (about 8x20 inches), then fold it into thirds like a letter. Wrap it and refrigerate for 30 minutes. You’ll repeat this rolling and folding *three times total*, chilling between each turn.

#### **4. Shape the Croissants (Day 2)**

After the final chill, roll the dough out to a 12x18 inch rectangle. Cut it into 3x4 inch rectangles. Place a few chocolate pieces (or chips) at one end of each rectangle and roll it up tightly.

Place the shaped croissants seam-side down on a baking sheet lined with parchment. Cover loosely and let them proof at room temp for 1–2 hours until puffy.

#### **5. Bake!**

Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Brush the croissants with a beaten egg for that golden shine.

Bake for 15–18 minutes or until beautifully golden brown. Let them cool slightly before devouring (or burning your mouth on molten chocolate—ask me how I know).
